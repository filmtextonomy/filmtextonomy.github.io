  <h1>Steve Neale and Film Genre Theory</h1>

  <p>Steve Neale is one of the most influential contemporary theorists of film genre. He argues that genre is not merely a category of form or content, but a <strong>cultural and institutional process</strong> within the film industry.</p>

  <p>According to Neale, genre operates through a balance of <strong>repetition and difference</strong>: films must repeat familiar elements while introducing variations to remain engaging. He also highlights the <strong>role of audience expectations</strong>, <strong>cultural norms</strong>, and <strong>the economic function of genre</strong> in shaping cinematic production.</p>

  <p>Neale's work is particularly valuable for understanding how genre intersects with ideology and media institutions. His key publications include <em>Genre and Hollywood</em> and <em>Questions of Cinema</em>. By linking genre theory with cultural studies and critical theory, Neale offers a deeper understanding of how genres work as systems of meaning, power, and entertainment in contemporary cinema.</p>
