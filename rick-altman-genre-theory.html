  <h1>Rick Altman and Film Genre Theory</h1>

  <p>Rick Altman is one of the most influential genre theorists in film studies. In his landmark book <em>Film/Genre</em>, he argues that genre should not be defined solely by surface features like style or imagery. Instead, he proposes a dual approach based on <strong>semantic</strong> (meaning-based) and <strong>syntactic</strong> (structural) elements.</p>

  <p>Altman sees genre as a dynamic process, not a fixed category—a cultural tool shaped by the interaction between films, audiences, and the film industry. He emphasizes that genres evolve over time and serve important social and interpretive functions.</p>

  <p>By shifting focus from rigid definitions to active engagement, Altman’s theory allows for a more flexible and audience-centered understanding of genre in contemporary cinema. His work continues to shape how scholars and filmmakers think about genre today.</p>
