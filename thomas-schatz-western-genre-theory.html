  <h1>Thomas Schatz and the Structural Approach to the Western Genre</h1>

  <p>Thomas Schatz is a major figure in genre theory, best known for his structural approach, especially in analyzing the classical Hollywood Western. In his seminal work <em>Hollywood Genres: Formulas, Filmmaking, and the Studio System</em> (1981), Schatz argued that genres function like cultural myths, each organized around a set of binary oppositions such as wilderness vs. civilization or individual vs. community.</p>

  <p>In his analysis of the Western, Schatz highlighted how the genre repeatedly dramatizes the tension between order and chaos, using a “ritualized” narrative form. The hero, often a reluctant gunfighter, serves as a transitional figure who restores balance to a morally unstable frontier society.</p>

  <p>Schatz’s framework placed emphasis on repetition and variation, proposing that genres evolve through a dialectical process: from experimental, classical, and refined phases to ultimately parodic forms. His insights remain central to understanding how the Western articulates American ideology, masculinity, and national identity.</p>
