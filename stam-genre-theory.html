  <h1>Robert Stam and Poststructuralist Genre Theory</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Alireza Kaveh</p>

  <p>Robert Stam critiques traditional genre theory from a poststructuralist perspective. He argues that genres are inherently fuzzy, overlapping, and constantly evolving categories.</p>

  <p>Instead of viewing genres as fixed or hierarchical, Stam sees them as cultural formations shaped by history, ideology, industry, and criticism.</p>

  <p>He emphasizes that films often participate in multiple genres simultaneously, resisting rigid classification.</p>

  <p>His influential book, <em>Film Theory: An Introduction</em>, reframes genre as a dynamic and dialogic process rather than a fixed label.</p>
