  <h1>Barry Keith Grant and the Expansion of Genre Theory</h1>

  <p>Barry Keith Grant is one of the most influential scholars of film genre, known more for his role as a <strong>categorizer, editor, and historical analyst</strong> than as a structural or ideological theorist. His work focuses on how genres evolve over time, how they function across different traditions—from documentary to horror—and how genre can serve as a cultural and analytical tool.</p>

  <p>Grant is best known for editing the landmark anthology <em>Film Genre Reader</em>, a foundational text that brings together key theoretical writings on genre. He has written extensively on horror, science fiction, and documentary film, helping to legitimize <strong>marginal or under-recognized genres</strong> within academic discourse.</p>

  <p>Grant’s approach is comparative and cross-media, extending genre theory beyond classical Hollywood into broader realms of media and culture. His contributions have significantly shaped genre studies by emphasizing inclusivity, diversity of form, and the ongoing transformation of genre across history and media platforms.</p>
