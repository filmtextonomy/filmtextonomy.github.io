      <h2>Genre as a Tool of Empire</h2>
      <p>
        Film genres, especially adventure, war, and westerns, have historically served colonial ideologies by reinforcing binary oppositions: civilized versus savage, West versus East. Edward Said‚Äôs concept of <em>Orientalism</em> reveals how genre cinema participates in constructing the "Other"‚Äîexotic, mysterious, and subordinate.

      <h2>Postcolonial Resistance in Genre Forms</h2>
      <p>
        Homi Bhabha‚Äôs ideas on mimicry and hybridity help us understand how postcolonial cinema re-appropriates genre structures. Bollywood melodrama, Nigerian action films, and Iranian historical dramas often subvert dominant genre codes while mimicking their surface forms, creating cultural friction and resistance.

      <h2>Science Fiction as Postcolonial Allegory</h2>
      <p>
        Scholars such as Anindita Banerjee argue that science fiction can operate as a postcolonial space. Films like <em>District 9</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Black Panther</em> dramatize themes of occupation, diaspora, and alienation‚Äîmirroring the postcolonial condition through speculative metaphors.

      <h2>Beyond Representation: Genre and Global Power</h2>
      <p>
        Postcolonial theory urges us to ask who defines genres, who gets to tell stories, and from where. As film industries globalize, the tension between dominant Western forms and alternative narrative traditions becomes central to understanding genre in the twenty-first century.
