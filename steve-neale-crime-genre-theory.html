  <h1>Steve Neale and the Crime Genre</h1>

  <p><strong>Author: L. H. Mirzaei</strong></p>

  <p>Steve Neale is a key figure in genre theory, particularly known for his structuralist analysis of cinematic categories. In his widely cited book <em>Genre and Hollywood</em>, Neale examines how classical narrative structures, visual codes, and ideological tensions are central to the experience of crime films.</p>

  <p>Neale argues that crime narratives often begin with social disorder and build toward a restoration of order, dramatizing the tension between law and transgression. Characters typically operate in moral gray zones, compelling the audience to grapple with questions of justice, power, and ethics.</p>

  <p>Importantly, Neale emphasizes repetition and difference. While crime films may follow similar narrative arcs, variations in tone, setting, characterization, and cultural context introduce richness and innovation. From noirs like <em>The Big Heat</em> to neo-noirs like <em>L.A. Confidential</em> and procedural thrillers like <em>Zodiac</em>, the genre evolves while maintaining recognizable traits.</p>

  <p>Recent scholarship has drawn on Neale’s framework to explore the ideological role of crime cinema in reinforcing or challenging dominant social values. His structuralist perspective continues to serve as a foundation for genre studies, especially in understanding how narrative and ideology intersect in popular film.</p>
