  <h1>Barry Collins and Cultural Genre Theory</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Alireza Kaveh</p>
  
  <p>Barry Collins is known for his cultural approach to film genre theory. Rather than seeing genre as a fixed narrative structure, he emphasizes its role as a dynamic cultural discourse. Collins argues that audiences actively participate in shaping and redefining genres, making them fluid and ideologically responsive.</p>

  <p>He critiques structuralist approaches that isolate genre from its social context and instead places genre within broader frameworks of class, ideology, and media consumption. His writings in the 1990s contributed significantly to the cultural turn in genre studies.</p>

  <p>Collins often explores how genres reflect and reproduce social hierarchies, particularly in relation to popular culture and television. He treats genre not as an internal system but as a cultural negotiation between producers, texts, and audiences.</p>

  <p>His work is often cited in studies of genre hybridity and audience reception. Collins' contributions remain essential in linking genre theory with cultural studies.</p>
