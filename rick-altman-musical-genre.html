  <h1>Rick Altman and the Musical Genre</h1>

  <p>Rick Altman is a leading figure in genre theory, especially known for his influential work on the musical. In his seminal book <em>The American Film Musical</em>, Altman introduced the concept of the "dual-focus narrative," where two characters from opposing social or ideological backgrounds are brought together through song and romance. This structure, he argued, was central to understanding the unique dynamics of the musical genre.</p>

  <p>Altman also challenged traditional genre theory by emphasizing the hybrid and evolving nature of genres. Rather than treating genres as fixed categories, he proposed that they are shaped by both industry practices and audience expectations. His approach allowed for greater flexibility in analyzing films that blend elements from multiple genres or resist clear classification.</p>

  <p>Importantly, Altman's theory extends beyond musicals to offer a broader critique of essentialist definitions of genre. His work opened new paths for studying how genre operates historically and culturally, with an emphasis on performance, spectacle, and emotional engagement.</p>

  <p>In contrast to earlier genre theories that focused on textual features or ideological structures alone, Altman placed significant weight on the experience of the viewer. He saw the musical not just as a formal system but as a mode of address—an invitation to participate emotionally and sensorially. This shift toward a more audience-centered analysis has influenced a wide range of genre studies since. Altman’s emphasis on performance, embodiment, and viewer pleasure situates the musical as a genre deeply attuned to cinema’s affective power.</p>
