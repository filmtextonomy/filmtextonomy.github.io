  <h1>Alireza Kaveh and the Five-Part Cinematic Taxonomy</h1>

  <p>Alireza Kaveh proposes a unique framework for classifying cinema, which goes beyond traditional genre theory. His five-category model includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Medium</li>
    <li>Style</li>
    <li>Genre</li>
    <li>Format</li>
    <li>Tradition</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Kaveh emphasizes that <strong>tone</strong>—the emotional and ideological atmosphere of a film—is essential for understanding genre identity. Tone, in his view, determines the value system of a cinematic work.</p>

  <p>His key work, <em>Film Genre: Tone and Ideology</em>, explores how genre interacts with tone, culture, and narrative across both Western and non-Western cinemas.</p>
